    <div class="nike">  
    <p>Analyzing rhetorical appeals, I researched Nike and their various information outlets.  I<br> discovered that Nike uses appeals of achievement, celebrity, and forward-thinking in<br> many of their commercials and posts. Through this project, I learned the various<br> ways companies appeal to both customers and potential investors in their business. </p></div>

    <div class="wireframe">  
    <p>When designing my site, a lot of preparation went into the design.  Creating a wireframe as seen<br> on the left, the colors, sizes, and relationship between elements were noted.  By spending time<br> carefully laying out my vision, I learned the importance of contrast and spacing in web creation.</p></div>

    <div class="brochure">  
    <p>Working with Michigan State's College Assistance Migrant Program, I worked in a group to simplify<br> the process of signing up for health insurance for childen of migrant workers. We created<br> an online pamphlet which lays out the steps necessary to register for health insurance.</p></div>
