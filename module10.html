	  <h1>Eric Flewelling's Module 10</h1>
	  <p>As I have been producing my HTML and CSS content on Codepen, I have been able to keep the content and presentation aspects of my site separate.  Because the HTML and CSS are neatly separated into two different boxes, I have been able to keep the design and content aspects of my site isolated.  This set-up has kept the process of creating the site fairly organized as the markup for each type has remained independent of the other.</p>
	  <p>After creating my content in HTML for paragraphs and pictures, I thought I had to create divs in HTML in order to make a header, footer, and navigation is CSS.  Originally I created ID’s and classes for each div and worked to create boxes that would serve as a header, footer, and navigation. Upon reviewing Codecademy activities and various research on the web, I understood that header, footer, and navigation tags could be made to simplify the process in HTML.  Once I understood the proper set-up for headers, footers, and navigation in HTML, I also reviewed the various properties for moving elements in CSS.  Looking over the activities regarding positioning, I worked to move elements of my site around with CSS.  Slowly I began to format and style the header, footer, and navigation in CSS.</p>
	  <p>Currently, I am working to size and move pictures around the site.  I am also attempting to move pictures along with their corresponding paragraphs in order to line them up directly below each other.  In the future I plan to use Codepen when coding websites.  It is extremely helpful to see what happens to certain aspects of the site by changing a value or property in live time.  By having HTML and CSS coding neatly lined up next to each other, the code often stays relatively organized.</p>
