	  <h1>Eric Flewelling's Module 11</h1>
	  <p>When deliberating with my scrum team, I often had many questions. I asked my group for guidance when starting my navigation at the beginning.  As I was unsure how to style the list that would eventually turn into my navigation, my scrum team was extremely helpful as they showed me how to set up my navigation in CSS.  On the second day of scrum team meetings, I was also confused on how to move individual images around.  My team as able to instruct me on the movement of individual pictures within each of my pages. As a few of the members of my scrum team were still working on design docs and other activities and thus were not yet working on their markup, I provided design advice to these scrum team members.  As the design of one team member included a white background, I advised that he include a colored background to add some interest to the site.  I also gave advice to another member working on design docs to adjust the spacing on some of her photos.  As a few of the images hugged the edge of the website, our group advised that the photos be moved toward the center of the site.  I learned to find answers to my obstacles by asking my group members, but more frequently, searching the internet for solutions.  I learned the importance of using appropriate HTML and CSS language when searching for answers to my questions.  .  I was successful when working in class on my portfolio.  I set goals for each class day and often completed these goals.  I expected to complete parts of my navigation, resize and move images, and add color to various parts of my website throughout each day of class. 
In my scrum team, Jack was extremely helpful as he was often knowledgeable about navigation and various other problems I encountered.  Online resources were also important in the creation of my portfolio.  A website that I found most useful was http://www.w3schools.com/css/ when trying to understand various properties of CSS. Another website that was helpful for both HTML and CSS solutions was http://stackoverflow.com/.  Both websites provided insight into effectively creating my design docs through effective markup.
